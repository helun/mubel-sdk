## Work in Progress
This library is under active development and is not yet recommended for use.

## Description
The mubel-sdk is a Java library aimed at simplifying the development of event-sourcing applications using the Mubel framework. Event sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern used to capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events. This SDK provides developers with tools to efficiently implement this pattern within their Java applications.
