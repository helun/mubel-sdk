# mubel-sdk

## Work in Progress

This library is under active development and is not yet ready for use.

## Description

The mubel-sdk is a Java library aimed at simplifying the development of event-sourcing applications using the Mubel
framework. Event sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern used to capture all changes to an application state as a
sequence of events. This SDK provides developers with tools to efficiently implement this pattern within their Java
applications.
